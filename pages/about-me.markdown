I am a Linux,opensource enthusiast,electronics engineer and a motorcyclist.

I use this site to share various things, mostly my work with computers. I’ve been using Linux since i brought my first computer in 2008. Some of the flavors i uses are Fedora,Ubuntu,Mint,Arch,Rasbian,Centos,RHEL.

I’ve done some long distance motorcycle trips.The places i visited are [Goa](/bike-trip-to-goa/), Pondicherry,Yelagiri,Bangalore,[Ooty](/bike-trip-to-ooty/) and many.

Since the name “vignesh” is bit lengthy to type, i chose the site based on my nick name “vikki”.
